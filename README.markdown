##What is Yaf?
Yaf is a pretty new PHP framework. To quote the introduction page:
"The Yet Another Framework(Yaf) extension is a PHP framework, used for developing web application, It provides OO interfaces to PHPer for developing web application. Yaf require PHP version greater than 5.2.1, and could not run with early version of PHP. "


##Cool! Where can I find more info?
Try looking at the [Yaf page on php.net](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.yaf.php)


##Wait, there is a page with examples! Why this?
The example code you can find on php.net contains errors and is not complete. This is a correct and working implementation of the example.

##Those examples do work! Shenanigans! Shenanigans!!!!
Calm down, maybe they fixed their example.
