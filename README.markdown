test push

##Cool! Where can I find more info?
Try looking at the [Yaf page on php.net](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.yaf.php)


##Wait, there is a page with examples! Why this?
The example code you can find on php.net contains errors and is not complete. This is a correct and working implementation of the example.

##Those examples do work! Shenanigans! Shenanigans!!!!
Calm down, maybe they fixed their example.
